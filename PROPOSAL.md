# Project Proposal
## Maze Game

I want to create a program that creates a maze, given a size using user input and that can solve that maze. The maze generation will be done using an algorithm that is able to create a one-solution maze while also creating a challenging map to solve. The user can interact with the maze by either drawing a line to solve it, or by moving around using W, A, S, D. The graphics can be displayed using the [sfml](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/graphics-draw.php) library, or the built in openframeworks one.

I will solve the maze either using an algorithm I develop or if I have enough time I can use a machine learning library such as [MLpack](https://www.mlpack.org/)
